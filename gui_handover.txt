GUI Drone Control

This program is used to send commands to the Tello Drone
using a graphical user interface and an exterimental
speech recognition interface. 

The GUI is provided by the PySimpleGUI module which can be 
installed with the command:
pip3 install PySimplGui or python3 -m pip install PySimpleGUi

The speech recognition module can be installed using:
pip3 install SpeechRecognition or python3 -m pip install SpeechRecognition

The program can be started by running the gui.py program:
python3 guiy.py

The GUI currently supports the main takeoff & landing commands, 
along with left, right, up, down and it's parameters in cm. The 'Speak'
button waits for a spoken command and attempts to send that as a command,
though this feature is still in early exterimental development.

The drone must be ready for a connection when the program is ran,
once a connection is established the GUI window will be created.

Future development will be adding CW and CCW commands along with
their required parameters. Development of the speech processing
must also be improved before shipping the product with this feature.
