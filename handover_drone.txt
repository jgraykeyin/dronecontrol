Tello Drone Control 

This program is used for sending commands to the Tello Drone 
in order perform specific function when comman is issued. 
It can be ran by running this command in the terminal:
python3 main.py

The user is prompted for a command that will be sent to the drone
and will then be asked for a parameter if the command requires one.

The drone instrutions are as follows :
   Commands that will prompt for a parameter of either cm or degrees:
   up, down, left, right, forward, back, cw , ccw, flip
   
   Commands that do not require paramters:
   takeoff, land

You can use the program by prompting the noarg-commands and standard commands only?
- The design of this program is to set the drone on specific commands to perform a task required by the user.

These commands help you download,initial and connect to the tello drone:
t = tello_abridged.Tello()
t.connect_and_initialize()

What about the code not in functions, what is the basic structure of that and roughly how does it work?
- The tello drone is design to only take commands available in the program application  
   
Future Work:
- I will like to see the drone perform more security functions eg taking picture on crime sence.
- A graphic user interface (GUI) so users can interact with the drone via mouse rather than typing commands.
   
Are there any extensions you’d make to this program to make it better?
- The change in the implementation I like to see is the Drone taking voice commands 
from different user and performing the commands accurately. (voice recognication)
   
Anything you’d change about the implementation now that it’s finished that a future
maintainer should know about?
- The maintainer should always ensure to check if the drone is charged to avoid inresposiveness
